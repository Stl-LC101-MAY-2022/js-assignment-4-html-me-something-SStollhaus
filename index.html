      <p>I have always loved to travel, camp and hike. Here are a few of my favorite places</p>
     <article>
      <h2>The Dominican Republic</h2>

      <p>My trip to the &quotDR&quot was the first time that I ever left the country on vacation. It is an amazing country. I spent a week at an All-Inclusicve resort. We went snorkling and on a catamaran cruise.</p>
      
      <h2>The Great Smoky Mountains</h3>

      <p>Camping and hiking in the GSMNP is such an amazing experience. I have been there 9 times for at least a week each time. I have completed almost all of the Appalachian Trail that runs through the park. The Clingman's Dome overlook allows you to see up to 100 miles in all directions from the highest point in the GSMNP.</p>
      
      <h2>Road Trip Across Texas</h4>
      <img src = "https://texaslodging.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Jeremy-T.-Walls.jpg" alt = "Big Bend National Park at night">
      <p id = "testP" class="funParagraph">I spent a week driving across Texas. We camped in Big Bend National Park and visited a half dozen other National Parks or Mounuments including the Alamo and the Guadalupe Mountain Range. </p>
